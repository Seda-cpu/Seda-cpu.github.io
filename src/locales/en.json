    "servantTTitle": "Deep Learning Based Pallet Pose Estimation System",
    "servantTDescription": "For the pallet pick-up operations of Servant-T, I built a deep learning–based pose estimation system. From the model outputs I extracted point cloud clusters, located the pallet, and applied map transformations.",
    "karmetaldeGerceklestirilmistir":"This study were carried out during the period when I worked in the Karmetal R&D team.",
    "servantWTitle": "Pallet Pose Estimation with Machine Learning Clustering Methods - a RANSAC Method",
    "servantWDescription": "I developed point cloud data processing algorithms to enable the autonomous mobile robot to reliably detect pallets even in low-light conditions. In this process, I used clustering methods such as RANSAC to separate the pallet object from other structures in the field.",
    "qrTitle":"QR Code Detection and Pose Estimation System",
    "qrDescription":"I developed an algorithm that enables the mobile robot to detect QR codes in the field and calculate their 3D positions relative to the camera. Thus, the robot was able not only to read the QR codes but also to calculate their positions in space and use them in navigation processes.",
    "KFMTitle":"KFM - Fleet Management System Web Application",
    "KFMDescription":"I developed a web-based interface to control and monitor robots. I designed and coded the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js, Flask) portions of this application. The application was developed to support integration and communication with ROS. I also handled the database management required by the system. Initially, this web application was configured to run locally.",
    "fersahTitle": "FERSAH - Unmanned Underwater Vehicle",
    "fersahDescription": "As a university team, I developed image-processing-based software to enable the unmanned underwater vehicle (ROV/AUV) we developed to perform autonomous tasks. I particularly focused on gate detection.",
